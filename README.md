# Brain decoding project

The work involved decoding neural activity from fMRI scans of the motor cortex. Three regions were scanned, namely the S1, M1 and SMA. These regions were scanned while the participant performed hand movements for the rock-paper-scissors games. The aim of the project is to classify which brain activity pattern represented by voxels is rock, paper, or scissors.
